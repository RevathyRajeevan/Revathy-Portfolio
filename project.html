                       <h2>RAILWAY CRACK TRACK DETECTION ROBOT</h2>
                       
                       <p>Railway Track Crack Detection Robot is an innovative solution designed to 
                           enhance railway safety and maintenance. Equipped with ultrasonic sensors, it
                            efficiently detects cracks in the tracks, ensuring early identification and
                             prevention of potential hazards. Additionally, it utilizes ultrasonic sensors 
                             to detect obstacles along the track, mitigating risks of derailments and accidents.
                           With integrated cameras, the robot provides real-time video footage of the track, 
                           enabling operators to visually inspect the area remotely. Moreover, it features a 
                           notification system that sends alerts directly to respective mobile devices, allowing 
                           for prompt action and maintenance interventions.This versatile robot is revolutionizing
                            railway maintenance practices, ensuring the reliability and safety of railway infrastructure
                             while minimizing downtime and operational disruptions.</p>
